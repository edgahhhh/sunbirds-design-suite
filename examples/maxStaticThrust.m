% Purpose of this script is to calculate the maximum static thrust of a
% propellor using momentum theory. The results are first cut and are
% overestimations

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 6x4.5B Propellor %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This analysis uses the maximum rated power of the motor, 111W, to
% estimate the maximum power driving the propellor. Then static thrust is
% estimated using cruising conditions (El Paso Summer day.
